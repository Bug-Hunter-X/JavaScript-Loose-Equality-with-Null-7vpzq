# JavaScript Loose Equality with Null
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to loose equality (==) and null comparisons.  The provided code uses loose equality, which can cause unexpected results, particularly when comparing null with other data types.

The bug showcases how this type of comparison can yield results that are not logically sound based on the intended behavior. The solution shows how to use strict equality (===) to prevent such errors.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a function that uses loose equality to check for null and other conditions. This approach results in an unexpected output in one of the test cases.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses strict equality to prevent these issues. Strict equality ensures a type-safe comparison, leading to more predictable and robust code.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a text editor or IDE.
3. Run the code using a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js, a web browser's console).
